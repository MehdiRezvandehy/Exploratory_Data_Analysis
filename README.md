Python functions are written to make nice data visualization including histogram, CDF, swarm plot, box plot, Violin plot, Kernel Density Estimation, cross plot and correlation. Probability distribution including binomial PMF, Poisson, Normal and Exponential distribution will be discussed. Finally data manipulation and data analysis with Pandas will be presented.
