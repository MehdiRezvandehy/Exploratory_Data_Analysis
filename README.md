# Exploratory_Data_Analysis

This notebook presents different approaches for exploratory data analysis and basic statistical analysis. Python functions are written to make nice data visualization including histogram, CDF, swarm plot, box plot, Violin plot, Kernel Density Estimation, cross plot and correlation. Probability distribution including binomial PMF, Poisson, Normal and Exponential distribution will be discussed. Finally data manipulation and data analysis with Pandas will be presented.

Python functions and data files to run this notebook are in my [Github](https://github.com/MehdiRezvandehy/Feature_Importance.git) page.
